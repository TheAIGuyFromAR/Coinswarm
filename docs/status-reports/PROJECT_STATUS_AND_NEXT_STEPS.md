# Project Status and Next Steps

## Chronological Project Status Summary

- **Phase 1 Completion:**
	- Initial data collection and ingestion pipeline established.
	- Core architecture for multi-agent system and memory layer implemented.
	- Early backtests show promising Sharpe and drawdown metrics.

- **Phase 2 Completion:**
	- Expanded data sources and improved data enrichment.
	- Refined agent orchestration and committee voting logic.
	- Major codebase refactor for maintainability and type safety.
	- Addressed critical bugs in pattern extraction and trade execution.

- **Phase 3 Progress:**
	- Live data ingestion and real-time pattern learning enabled.
	- Quorum-governed memory system deployed and validated.
	- Comprehensive code review identified and fixed high-priority issues (missing imports, type safety, logging, risk checks).
	- Deployment pipeline hardened; all critical issues resolved for production.

- **Recent Session Summaries:**
	- Multiple sessions focused on strategy discovery, data fetch reliability, and agent performance tuning.
	- Final solution summary: system achieves robust, adaptive trading with multi-source data and agent ensemble.
	- Status: All major milestones complete; system ready for continuous improvement and scaling.

- **Next Steps:**
	- Ongoing monitoring and incremental improvements.
	- Expand pattern library and optimize agent weights.
	- Continue codebase quality reviews and address any new issues promptly.
	- Prepare for additional exchange integrations and larger-scale deployments.
