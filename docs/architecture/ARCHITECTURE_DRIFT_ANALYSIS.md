# Architecture Drift Analysis

This document analyzes the drift between the intended architecture and the current implementation of the Coinswarm system. It highlights areas where the codebase, deployment, or agent logic has diverged from the original design, and provides recommendations for realignment.

## 1. Overview

- Intended architecture: See `docs/architecture/hierarchical-temporal-decision-system.md` and `docs/architecture/quorum-memory-system.md`
- Current implementation: See codebase and deployment reports

## 2. Areas of Drift

- [ ] Agent role boundaries
- [ ] Memory system enforcement
- [ ] Deployment pipeline deviations
- [ ] Pattern learning integration

## 3. Recommendations

- Realign codebase with architecture docs
- Enforce memory quorum rules in all agents
- Update deployment scripts to match intended flow
- Schedule regular architecture reviews
